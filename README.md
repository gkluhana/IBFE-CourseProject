Immersed Boundary Method with Finite Elements.

Original 2D Matlab Implementation by Charles S. Peskin available here: https://www.math.nyu.edu/~peskin/ib_lecture_notes/index.html

Code was modified to add finite element discretizations for the Lagrangian body.


To run the code use ib2d.m file. Modifications to initalized parameters can be done in initialize.m to set up parameters for Finite Element/ Finite Difference discretizations. The script finite_elements should only be run if using Finite Element parameters.
